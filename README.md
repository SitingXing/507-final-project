<h1>507 Final Project</h1>
<h4>Siting Xing</h4>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a Flask web application that allows users to generate tables and graphs showing the data and relationship between energy consumption and weather patterns. Specifically, users can select from three energy sources (coal, electricity, and natural gas) and three weather patterns (temperature, precipitation, and wind) to generate a customized graph using the Plotly library.

The application includes a form with dropdown menu where users can select their desired state, energy source, weather pattern, and time period. Once the user submits their selections, the Flask app passes these information to a Python script that retrieves the relevant data and formats it appropriately for Plotly.

The resulting graph is displayed within the Flask app using Plotly's interactive visualization tools, allowing users to explore the data further by hovering over data points, zooming in/out, and more.

Overall, this project is a useful tool for analyzing the relationship between energy consumption and weather patterns, and the Flask and Plotly libraries provide a powerful and user-friendly platform for creating and sharing these visualizations.
